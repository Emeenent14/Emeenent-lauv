## Why useEffect exists
React’s rendering is pure — it shouldn’t run side effects in the middle of rendering. `useEffect` is the safe space for that.

## The Dependency Trap
Your effect re-runs when dependencies change. Forgetting them = stale data. Adding everything blindly = infinite loops.

## Fixing It
- Always include dependencies you use inside the effect.
- If you can, use memoized callbacks (`useCallback`) to avoid re-renders.
