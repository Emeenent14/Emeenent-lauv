## Think of It Like This
A neural network is a bunch of math layers passing numbers through activation functions — like gossip spreading but with math.

## Key Parts
- **Input layer**: Your data.
- **Hidden layers**: Where the magic happens.
- **Output layer**: The prediction.

    codes={[
      {
        code:
`# Pseudo-code for a single neuron
output = activation(sum(weights * inputs) + bias)`,
        language: "python",
        label: "neuron.py"
      }
    ]}
