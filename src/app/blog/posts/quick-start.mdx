## About

SafeSwap is a fintech application built to solve one of the biggest trust problems in digital transactions: **who goes first**?  

Buying a laptop from an online marketplace like Jiji? One of you must pay first without any guarantee the other will comply. Hiring a remote worker? They might complete the work and never get paid.  

SafeSwap changes that by introducing **secure escrow transactions**. Funds are deposited upfront and released only when both parties confirm the deal is complete. No scams, no ghosting — just safe transactions.

## The Problem It Solves

- **Online Marketplace Deals (Jiji, OLX, Craigslist)**  
  Buyers fear losing money, sellers fear shipping without payment. SafeSwap solves both sides with a neutral middle layer.

- **Freelancer & Client Protection**  
  Remote workers often suffer from unpaid work. SafeSwap ensures clients fund the project before work starts and releases payment only after mutual approval.

- **Global & Crypto Transactions** *(Coming Soon)*  
  SafeSwap plans to integrate cryptocurrency for cross-border deals, making global payments faster and more secure.
