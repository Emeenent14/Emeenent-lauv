## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support** → Native apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **SQLite Persistence** → Local database for reliable data storage
- **Full CRUD Operations** → Complete server management capabilities
- **IPC Communication** → Seamless frontend-backend communication via Tauri
- **Lightweight** → Small binary size with minimal resource usage

---

## Technical Implementation

### Rust Backend (Tauri)
- Built IPC communication layer between frontend and Rust backend
- Implemented SQLite database with full CRUD operations
- Leveraged Rust's memory safety for reliable server management

### React Frontend
- Modern React with TypeScript for type safety
- Clean, intuitive UI for server configuration
- Real-time status updates and server monitoring

---

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Systems programming for the backend core
- **Tauri**: Cross-platform desktop framework
- **React** + **TypeScript**: Frontend interface
- **SQLite**: Embedded database for local persistence
- **IPC**: Inter-process communication for frontend-backend bridge

---

## Architecture Highlights

- **Security First**: Tauri's security model limits frontend access to only exposed APIs
- **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions ensure minimal overhead
- **Offline Ready**: SQLite persistence allows full functionality without network

---

## Why Tauri?

Tauri offers significant advantages over Electron:
- **Smaller binary sizes** (10-20MB vs 150MB+)
- **Lower memory footprint**
- **Better security model**
- **Native OS integration**

This makes Relay fast, secure, and efficient across all platforms.
