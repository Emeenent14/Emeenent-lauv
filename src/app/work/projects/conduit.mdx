## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- Developed RESTful APIs with Express.js
- Implemented secure credential encryption and storage
- Built integration layer with n8n's workflow engine

### Infrastructure
- Containerized entire stack with Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- Redis for caching and message queuing
- n8n as the automation execution engine

---

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Frontend framework for the user interface
- **Express.js**: Backend API server
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development across the stack
- **Docker**: Containerization for all services
- **n8n**: Workflow automation engine
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database
- **Redis**: Caching and queue management

---

## Use Cases

Conduit enables non-technical users to automate:
- **Email workflows** → Automatic responses, forwarding, categorization
- **Data sync** → Keep spreadsheets, databases, and apps in sync
- **Notifications** → Slack, email, or SMS alerts based on triggers
- **Social media** → Scheduled posts and engagement tracking
- **Business processes** → Order fulfillment, invoice generation, CRM updates

## Why Conduit?

While n8n is powerful, it requires technical knowledge to set up and configure. Conduit bridges this gap by:
- Providing pre-configured templates
- Handling infrastructure complexity
- Offering a simplified, guided UI
- Managing credentials securely

This makes automation accessible to everyone, not just developers.
