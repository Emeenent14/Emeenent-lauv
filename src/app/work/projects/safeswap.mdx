## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was creating an interface that is **simple enough for casual users** yet **powerful enough for businesses and freelancers**. Escrow systems can seem intimidating, so building intuitive user flows and clear transaction statuses was a major priority.  

We also focused on **design consistency and reusability**, leveraging shadcn’s UI components for faster development while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic.  

On the backend, ensuring **transaction safety and atomic operations** was critical, especially for handling disputes and future crypto integration.
