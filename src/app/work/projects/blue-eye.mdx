## Overview

Blue-Eye is an **AI-powered learning environment** built to help students **study smarter, not harder**. It combines intelligent problem-solving, peer-driven knowledge sharing, and collaborative discussions in one intuitive platform.  

The vision? **Transform education into an interactive, AI-driven experience where help is always one click away.**

## Key Features

- **AI Learning Assistant**  
  Get instant answers, detailed explanations, and context-based guidance powered by advanced language models.

- **Resource Sharing**  
  Upload and access tutorials, class notes, and reference materials — everything you need in one place.

- **Peer Collaboration**  
  Engage in subject-specific discussions, Q&A sessions, and real-time chat rooms.

- **Dynamic Search & Categorization**  
  Intelligent tagging and filtering to make finding resources effortless.

- **Clean, Distraction-Free UI**  
  Designed for focus — minimal clutter, maximum learning efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (REST API), PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS  
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for problem-solving and adaptive assistance  
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Dockerized backend  
- **Authentication**: JWT & OAuth for secure access

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating AI while maintaining **speed and accuracy** was a key challenge. We implemented **caching for repeated queries** and optimized API call structures to reduce latency.  

Building a **collaborative platform that feels simple but is packed with features** required modular UI components and a robust backend architecture for scalability.

## Outcome

Blue-Eye has shown that **AI can be a real partner in learning**. Test groups reported:  
- Faster problem-solving with AI-assisted explanations.  
- Increased engagement through interactive discussions and shared resources.  

This project demonstrates my ability to **combine AI, scalability, and user-focused design** to create meaningful tech solutions.
